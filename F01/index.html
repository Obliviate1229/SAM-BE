                <div class="cat-title">Grumpy Cat</div>
                <div class="cat-text">This iconic cat named Tardar Sauce was first posted on Reddit in September 2012,
                    reaching more than 25,300 up votes in 24 hours, and nearly 1,030,000 views in the first 48 hours on
                    Imgur. Unlike some of the previous entries that were photoshopped, Tardar naturally had this
                    extremely grumpy face, which is mainly why he became such a legend. It seems inevitable that
                    netizens turned Tardar into a meme, with the grumpiest captions they could think of. He eventually
                    had a website, social media accounts with over a million followers and scores of merchandise. Sadly,
                    in May 2019, Grumpy Cat died at age seven after contacting a urinary tract infection. His legacy
                    however, still lives on.</div>

                <div class="cat-text">On June 7th, 2018, this photograph of a cat was submitted to the humor site 9gag
                    in June 2018 and gathered upwards of 1,200 points within two months. Netizens noted how polite it
                    looked, and ran with it, creating multiple variations over time. The meme is often used to address
                    having to ‘suck it up’ in unpleasant situations, and though the cat’s photoshopped face is a little
                    unnatural, it definitely sums up how one feels under said circumstances.</div>

                <div class="cat-text">The angry accusing image is of Taylor Armstrong having a meltdown in an episode
                    from season 2 of Real Housewives of Beverly Hills in December 2011. The cat, named Smudge, appeared
                    on Tumblr in June 2018 and itself, gained over 50,300 likes and reblogs in one year. But it was only
                    in May 2019 when Twitter user @MISSINGEGIRL put the 2 images together did it really blow up. It
                    gained over 78,900 retweets and 276,800 likes in two months and has since allowed netizens to come
                    up with all sorts of uses for it.</div>

                <div class="cat-title">Crying Cat</div>
                <div class="cat-text">The meme first appeared in 2014 from an anonymous meme generator but reached its
                    peak in late 2019. The original features a white cat, photoshopped to look teary-eyed and absolutely
                    inconsolable. It then became a trend that featured other cats with the same expression in various
                    situations to allude to different circumstances. Why it’s funny is that it exaggerates the sadness
                    of everyday experiences that people can easily relate to, and well, who can turn away from a
                    distraught kitty?</div>

                <div class="cat-text">Speaking of the ongoing pandemic, here’s a cat that really needs to wear a mask.
                    In Dec 2018, Twitter user @40ozAliah posted a photo of a cat with a photoshopped cat, pointing out
                    that it looks like how children cough. It might have been the uncanny resemblance, or just how
                    strange the image looked, but the tweet went viral, garnering close to 600,000 likes to date. Not
                    only did people validate the likeness in various forms of tweets, coughing cat became so popular
                    that companies are even making t-shirts, mugs, and phone cases with the memes image. Talk about
                    viral!</div>
